# Project Description

The purpose of the project is to parse NMEA sentences and visualize the output data with QML or Tkinter based UI. We will gather the NMEA messages with TCP/IP Protocols, parse them using [NMEA-Parser](https://github.com/Alperencode/NMEA-Parser) that we created using [pynmea2](https://github.com/Knio/pynmea2) module and update the UI in real-time.
